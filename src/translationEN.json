And if this stops, just as the river turns into a swamp, so life will begin to sour, rot and die. Development and prosperity is the duty of every person.",

  "aboutMe1": "Many years ago, I got acquainted with an ancient culture, according to the philosophy of which, man is an incredible creature that is constantly developing and changing. A person is a process, so say modern yogis!According to this, life is a constant assimilation of energies and their transformation into material - into physical abilities, eventually talents (of course not without a spiritual aspect, but this topic is worth a separate site:)). And I support it!!! The time of our upbringing somehow created the illusion that a person should choose one profession for the rest of his life, which I do not agree with one hundred percent! Such a restriction stops and condemns to a pure existence, and it contradicts the laws of evolution. In my opinion, we should start learning from what our teachers stopped at, in everything - then knowledge and thought will be forced to move on. ",

The four of us had only one half-empty suitcase and a bag with the food that was in the fridge at the time. I remember traffic jams, incredible queues at gas stations and ATMs, frightened eyes all around, crowded old cars barely moving, not understanding anything, the feeling of being 'in nowhere'... And also nausea, a constant lump in my throat that prevented me from eating and drinking. From the east to the western cities, we drove for about a week, spent the night somewhere, drove again, and did not understand anything. WAR.",
